# Assignment 11 (Vandaluino2)

- Add a task to your last Servo Motor program to control the 4 Pixel (neopixel â€“ SK6812RBGW) LEDs on your Vandalino2 board.

- You have the test code for the Pixels.  Start with that.

- Remember that the serial timing for using these Pixels is tight.

- Make your task take commands from a queue

Have it:

- Set a specific color for a specific LED

- Set brightness for each individual Pixel

- Take a command to do the rainbow effect

- Write Test code (within your Servo motor code) to run a demo of all the features.   Figure out a way of triggering the test code.
